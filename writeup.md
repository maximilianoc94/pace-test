Hi Pace Team!

I liked this assignment a lot, seemed simple at first but it became more challenger as I dig deeper. I'll answer the example questions straight ahead for simplicity.

What choices did you make and why?

- I started with a CRA with the typescript template, it's what I'm most used to work with .

- I decided to use inline styling, basically for the simplicity of it. Didn't want to spend too much time on files for styles. Although I should clarify that normally I do these in a separated file and use modular scss.

- I also didn't focus in responsiveness. I prioritized a fully functional desktop app.

What challenges did you face? What tradeoffs did you choose? What do you like and not like about your solution? What areas would you work on next?
